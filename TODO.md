# TODO LIST


- [X] Create priorityQ
- [ ] Parse arguments from terminal ( when structure and features are decided )
- [ ] Huffman Coding/Decoding as below
- [ ] Read a file to multiple processes / threads, count occurrences of binary data ( 1 byte, 2 byte or 4 bytes at the time as alphabet, check for ull overflows because they might affect encoding efficiency )
- [ ] Join counts ( reduce )
- [ ] Create Tree ( single process )
- [ ] Create binary code for tree nodes ( single process ? )
- [ ] Use binary code to encode ( multi process )
- [ ] Test over all possibilities ( parallelism, data size, alphabet size, file type, etc)
- [ ] 4 page report
- [ ] 4 pages very simple slides
