# TODO LIST


- [X] Create priorityQ
- [X] Parse arguments from terminal ( when structure and features are decided )
- [X] Huffman Coding/Decoding as below
- [x] Read a file to multiple processes / threads, count occurrences of binary data ( 1 byte at the time check for ull overflows because they might affect encoding efficiency )
- [x] Join counts ( reduce )
- [X] Create Tree ( single process )
- [X] Create binary code for tree nodes ( single process ? )
- [X] Use binary code to encode ( multi process )
- [ ] Better thread parallelism with simultaneus read
- [ ] Divide number of files according to the size of each
- [X] Add to main an option the N_THREADS required instead of ricompiling
- [ ] Test serial version vs parallel with N_THREADS=1 for overhead
- [ ] Test over all possibilities ( parallelism, data size, alphabet size, file type, etc)
- [ ] 4 page report
- [ ] 4 pages very simple slides
