\section{Parallel Huffman Implementation}
The application is developed with the C99 programming language, using MPI for multiprocessing and OpenMP for multithreading to scale horizontally with increasing hardware resources. We choose to use:
\begin{itemize}
    \item multiple processes to process groups of file and folders separately;
    \item multiple threads to process different chunk of the same file in parallel.
\end{itemize}
